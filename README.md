# python_challenge

1. I had the last minute issues with pushing the files in and was not able to upload the Resource/input csv file for the poll task, it turned out to be too large. My code has been submitted, I've used the standard file.

2. I had to resubmit the bank_main.py file since I manage to submit the wrong file at first - apologies for that. The output file was submitted on time and hasn't been changed after original submission.
